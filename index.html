      <span>Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might</span>
      <span>connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.</span>
      <span>Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and</span>
      <span>most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
